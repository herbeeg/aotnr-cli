# Aeon of the New Republic

**Aeon of the New Republic** is a CLI tool that allows users to create a character, much like one would when playing a Role-Playing game, share updates about their achievements for the day and connect with other user groups to form accountability and "mastermind" circles.

## Republics

**Republics** are a way for users to break out of the entire community, into smaller, closely-tied groups that can communicate more intimately with each other down to a one-to-one basis. This is especially helpful when dealing with individual project tasks and ideas, as well as communication for those that personally knew each other before joining the *AotNR* community. 

### List

There are seven available **Republics** to join, based on who you want to group up with and ultimately, what your favourite colour is:

- Aether Red
- Equine Orange
- Oolong Yellow
- Nebula Green
- Raptor Blue
- Encore Violet
- Pewter Purple

While there are no entry requirements for each **Republic**, the hope is that certain types of users will gravitate towards specific ones based on their personality, as well as **Skills** and **Traits**. There is no guarantee that this will be the case and diversity within each **Republic** will always be promoted.

### Joining Republics

### Switching Republics

Users can change which **Republic** they are assigned to every thirty days so make sure you choose wisely when you make the switch! Staying within your **Republic** is encouraged so you can build up rapport with your peers but there are occasions where, naturally, personalities don't gel together or users are looking for something different.
